# Class_Manager
Hey guys. This is my second python project. It is a simple command-line based program to help calculate statistics for a class. You must input your student's names and for each of them you are asked to input their respective homework, quiz, and test grades. Then you are asked to input the weighting for each category. The program will output multiple calculations for the individual students and the class as a whole. 

Again, this is my second project and probably can be improved (and may be in the future)
